It is very important to have a base case, otherwise, the program will never end and it will eventually crash. Our base case is if x is 0. Then, we know we reached zero and need to stop the program. If we are not at zero, but rather at 10, we will skip that if statement and print the value of zeroToX(x-1). This repeats until we get the base case. Once x == 0, then we return 0. Then, once that is printed, we return the original number. After 0, it will be 1. Once that is printed, then 2 is printed, all the way to 10."
